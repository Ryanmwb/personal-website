                        Animation is the process of creating the illusion of motion and shape change 
                        by means of the rapid display of a sequence of static images that minimally differ 
                        from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely 
                        on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of 
                        animation.
